# Intership-Report-at-King-s-College-London

Here is my report of the intership I made on summer 2019 at King's College London in the Developmental Neurobiology Department.
My supervisor was Dr. Wingate. I studied snakes cerebellum, and their Purkinje cells ordering. I was lucky to follow 3 different kind of staining protocols : Nissl stain, Immunohistochemistry, and Golgi stain.
